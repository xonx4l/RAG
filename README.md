# What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?

Retrieval Augmented Generation is an AI framework for improving the quality of LLM responses. This is done by providing documents or other kinds of data (for example, images) that improve the LLMâ€™s internal representation of information.

This has a few benefits:

You can provide users with the latest facts instead of relying on outdated training data.
The chance of LLM hallucinations and sensitive data leakages are reduced.
RAG can work with loads of different types of data, as long as you can embed it.
RAG has recently gained a lot of popularity in use cases that require knowledge bases, for example:

Support ticket work (being able to automate answering common questions)
Searching a database of business documents to generate a report/analysis
